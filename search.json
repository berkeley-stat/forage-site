    "text": "We’ve found the following wild and feral edible plants in the East Bay urban ecosystem. “Spp.” after a genus name means we found more than one species. Species in bold font are particularly abundant.\nSpecies with edible parts are highlighted in green.\nNot all parts of nominally “edible” plants are edible: Parts of some edible plants are toxic.\nEdible parts of some nominally “edible” plants require special preparation to be edible. For instance, coast live oak acorns (Quercus agrifolia), California bay laurel nuts (Umbellularia californica), California buckeye nuts (Aesculus californica), bamboo shoots (Bambusa spp., Chimonobambusa spp., Phyllostachys spp.), and pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) range from inedible to toxic unless they are prepared properly. Edible parts of some “edible” plants are edible only at particular stages of their development.\nDo not rely on the “common name” to identify a plant: There are different plants with the same common name, some of which are edible and some of which are toxic. For instance, in some parts of the country, Queen Anne’s Lace refers to an edible wild carrot (Daucus carota), and in others it refers to poison hemlock, (Conium maculatum). Mistakes can be fatal.\nCalflora has a list of toxic plants according to the California Poison Control System.\nDo not consume any part of any plant listed here unless you are quite sure you know what

    "text": "We’ve found relatively few inedible or toxic species that resemble edible species in the East Bay. Here they are:\n\nChickweed (Stellaria media) looks like Scarlet Pimpernel (Anagallis arvensis). Chickweed has a single row of hairs along the stem, and white flowers. Scarlett pimpernel has scarlet flowers (coral-red), and the stems have hairs all around (not just in a single row).\nCow parsnip (Heracleum maximum) might be confused with Poison hemlock (Conium maculatum). They don’t look extremely similar, but Poison hemlock is one of the most poisonous plants in the Bay Area, so be cautious!\nMallow (Malva neglecta and Malva sylvestris) looks like geranium (Pelargonium hirsutum and Pelargonium cucullatum). Mallow leaves are more delicate and unctuous; their flavor is mild. They don’t have much scent if you crush them. The flowers are generally bluish, pink, or white. Pelargonium leaves are very pungent and herbal if you crush them. The stems are thicker than mallow stems, and they have far more flowers than mallow, often red, pink, or purple in the Bay Area.\nThe leaves of oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare) look somewhat similar to the leaves of Groundsel (Senecio vulgaris). Both are in the family Asteracea.\nPennyroyal (Mentha pulegium) can cause liver damage and death. It smells like spearmint (Mentha spicata) or coyote mint (Monardella villosa) and the flowers look like those of purple sage (Salvia leucophylla), but smaller.\n\n\n\n\nWE’D LOVE YOUR HELP!\n\nVolunteer or donate to BOSF\nLATEST NEWS\n\nOur Field Guide to 13 delicious edible plants in the Bay Area, many of which are abundant worldwide, might help people improve their food security in the age of COVID-19. 8th Annual Wild/Feral Food Week 20-28 May 2022!

Grocery stores could empty rapidly, and your earthquake emergency kit may quickly be exhausted.\nFortunately, there is a ready supply of fresh, nutritious, delicious produce in your neighborhood: wild and feral edible plants.\nForaging won’t meet all your dietary needs, but it can extend your emergency supplies and make them more palatable and nutritious. That canned tuna in your bug-out bag will be much more appetizing mixed with chopped wild onions and purple sage, on a bed of wild mustard and chickweed.\nOn this one-hour (gentle) walk, you will learn to identify a number of delicious, nutritious wild foods that grow in virtually every Bay Area neighborhood.\nThis guided walking tour will start at the Community Emergency Prep Fair taking place on Saturday, October 12 from 10 am - 3 pm in James Kenney Park, Berkeley. We will gather at noon near the entrance to the Fair (Look for signs reading “Urban Foraging Walk at Noon - Meet Here”), and walk from there.\nLed by Philip B. Stark, Berkeley Open Source Food.\nQuestions? Contact Gradiva Couzin at 415-341-2574.\nAlso check out other Festivals in Berkeley."

Vi ingår i samma system, lever under samma villkor och följer samma cykler. Den här dagen får du djupdyka i dig själv som natur – existentiellt och konkret och hitta nya vägar att omfamna livets förändring. Under en vårdag kombinerar vi existentiellt utforskande med skogsvandringar och direktkontakt med naturen.\nSÅ HÄR GÅR DET TILL Först närmar vi oss det existentiella. Vad är det att vara en del av naturen, att leva i metamorfos, att vara i ständig förändring. Sedan går vi ut i skogen runt knuten. Möter naturens pånyttfödelse. Och där i en glänta får du lära dig mer om vilda växter, och hur de kan bli en del av din matkultur. På vägen hem plockar vi det vi behöver för att laga en vild vegetarisk måltid tillsammans. Efter maten får du en stund för dig själv – vandra, skriv, fundera. Sedan samlas vi, fikar och reflekterar kring hur metamorfos kan vara en del av vår livsförståelse.\nKURSLEDARE Ann Lagerström, existentiell samtalsledare och författare bidrar med existentiell filosofi och psykologi.

Vilda växter förtjänar en högre status. Låt maskrosor, kirskål och svinmålla frodas istället , och ät upp dem. Vilda ätliga växter är inte bara kokheta inom den moderna gastronomin, men också bland det mest näringsrika och miljövänliga du kan äta. Och ett fantastiskt sätt att knyta an till naturen.\nFör att plocka och använda vilda växter krävs kunskap om hur och var man får plocka, hur man identifierar vad som är ätligt och hur växterna tillagas. Under vandringen får du tips om hur vanliga vilda växter tillagas till mat, samt hudvårdsprodukter och hur de kan förbättra din hälsa. Lisen Sundgren är herbalist, forager, författare och en ivrig förespråkare för ett liv i samklang med naturen.

    "text": "Many wild and feral foods are delicious, with flavors and textures that are different from cultivated foods. They provide a special culinary opportunity, specific to season and locale.\nForaging should be conducted responsibly, in a way that promotes biodiversity, sustainability, and resilience of the food system and of our individual diets. Foraging practices must consider time and place. We endorse and follow the principles of the Association of Foragers.\nWild and feral foods on farms can provide biodiversity, resilience, delicious nutrition, and income. We encourage farmers to embrace wild and feral foods as economic cover crops, to “harvest between the rows,” and to bring wild and feral foods to market.\nBy expanding food choices and raising public awareness, we seek to promote a just, inclusive, sustainable, resilient, biodiverse, restorative, nutritious food system that supports public health and reduces the negative consequences of industrial systems of food production.\nWe advocate public policies that allow and encourage responsible foraging on public land. In addition to its health and educational benefits, foraging, especially of non-native invasive species, can play an important role in “pest” control.\nForaging is healthful not only because of the nutrients it puts on the table: the activity itself is good for our bodies and our brains. It promotes healthy ecosystems by encouraging stewardship of natural resources and personal responsibility for our habitat—be it wild, rural, suburban, or urban. It feeds and sustains social, cultural, and economic relationships and ancestral knowledge.\nFood culture is world heritage. Everyone should learn to recognize common edible plants. Knowledge of wild and feral food should be available to all. For this reason, we do not claim any proprietary rights to information about wild and feral foods, and we share all our work using permissive licenses, such as CC-BY.\n\n\n\n\nWE’D LOVE YOUR HELP!\n\nVolunteer or donate to BOSF\nLATEST NEWS\n\nOur Field Guide to 13 delicious edible plants in the Bay Area, many of which are abundant worldwide, might help people improve their food security in the age of COVID-19. 8th Annual Wild/Feral Food Week 20-28 May 2022!
