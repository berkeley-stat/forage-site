    "text": "Many wild and feral foods are delicious, with flavors and textures that are different from cultivated foods. They provide a special culinary opportunity, specific to season and locale.\nForaging should be conducted responsibly, in a way that promotes biodiversity, sustainability, and resilience of the food system and of our individual diets. Foraging practices must consider time and place. We endorse and follow the principles of the Association of Foragers.\nWild and feral foods on farms can provide biodiversity, resilience, delicious nutrition, and income. We encourage farmers to embrace wild and feral foods as economic cover crops, to “harvest between the rows,” and to bring wild and feral foods to market.\nBy expanding food choices and raising public awareness, we seek to promote a just, inclusive, sustainable, resilient, biodiverse, restorative, nutritious food system that supports public health and reduces the negative consequences of industrial systems of food production.\nWe advocate public policies that allow and encourage responsible foraging on public land. In addition to its health and educational benefits, foraging, especially of non-native invasive species, can play an important role in “pest” control.\nForaging is healthful not only because of the nutrients it puts on the table: the activity itself is good for our bodies and our brains. It promotes healthy ecosystems by encouraging stewardship of natural resources and personal responsibility for our habitat—be it wild, rural, suburban, or urban. It feeds and sustains social, cultural, and economic relationships and ancestral knowledge.\nFood culture is world heritage. Everyone should learn to recognize common edible plants. Knowledge of wild and feral food should be available to all. For this reason, we do not claim any proprietary rights to information about wild and feral foods, and we share all our work using permissive licenses, such as CC-BY.\n\n\n\n\nWE’D LOVE YOUR HELP!\n\nVolunteer or donate to BOSF\nLATEST NEWS\n\nOur Field Guide to 13 delicious edible plants in the Bay Area, many of which are abundant worldwide, might help people improve their food security in the age of COVID-19. 8th Annual Wild/Feral Food Week 20-28 May 2022!

All food can be contaminated with bacteria, viruses, and organic and inorganic residues. E. coli O157:H7 contamination of commercial vegetables has killed people in the US and Europe.

Differences among wild edibles quickly become just as obvious.

Ideally, go foraging with someone knowledgable and reliable. iNaturalist also lets you post photos and ask for community help identifying species.\nThere is a natural temptation to make the plant fit the description. Resist it. We all want to find things, but if the description says “opposite leaves” and the plant in your hand has alternate leaves, it isn’t the same plant—no matter whether everything else in the description matches. Ignoring this may get you sick, or worse.\nThe first time you try something, take a small bite and chew. If it seems noxious, spit it out: don’t swallow it. If it seems OK, limit yourself to a small portion the first time, in case you have an adverse reaction, because you misidentified it or because you have an allergy or other sensitivity.\n\n\n\n\nWE’D LOVE YOUR HELP!\n\nVolunteer or donate to BOSF\nLATEST NEWS\n\nOur Field Guide to 13 delicious edible plants in the Bay Area, many of which are abundant worldwide, might help people improve their food security in the age of COVID-19. 8th Annual Wild/Feral Food Week 20-28 May 2022!

    "text": "It will happen quickly with practice: Most people can tell iceberg lettuce from romaine lettuce without thinking. Differences among wild edibles quickly become just as obvious. They will soon be “old friends” and you will notice them everywhere.\nUse several sources to identify new foods—don’t rely on one picture or one authority. Ideally, go foraging with someone knowledgable and reliable. iNaturalist also lets you post photos and ask for community help identifying species.\nThere is a natural temptation to make the plant fit the description. Resist it. We all want to find things, but if the description says “opposite leaves” and the plant in your hand has alternate leaves, it isn’t the same plant—no matter whether everything else in the description matches. Ignoring this may get you sick, or worse.\nThe first time you try something, take a small bite and chew. If it seems noxious, spit it out: don’t swallow it. If it seems OK, limit yourself to a small portion the first time, in case you have an adverse reaction, because you misidentified it or because you have an allergy or other sensitivity."

    "text": "We’ve found relatively few inedible or toxic species that resemble edible species in the East Bay. Here they are:\n\nChickweed (Stellaria media) looks like Scarlet Pimpernel (Anagallis arvensis). Chickweed has a single row of hairs along the stem, and white flowers. Scarlett pimpernel has scarlet flowers (coral-red), and the stems have hairs all around (not just in a single row).\nCow parsnip (Heracleum maximum) might be confused with Poison hemlock (Conium maculatum). They don’t look extremely similar, but Poison hemlock is one of the most poisonous plants in the Bay Area, so be cautious!\nMallow (Malva neglecta and Malva sylvestris) looks like geranium (Pelargonium hirsutum and Pelargonium cucullatum). Mallow leaves are more delicate and unctuous; their flavor is mild. They don’t have much scent if you crush them. The flowers are generally bluish, pink, or white. Pelargonium leaves are very pungent and herbal if you crush them. The stems are thicker than mallow stems, and they have far more flowers than mallow, often red, pink, or purple in the Bay Area.\nThe leaves of oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare) look somewhat similar to the leaves of Groundsel (Senecio vulgaris). Both are in the family Asteracea.\nPennyroyal (Mentha pulegium) can cause liver damage and death. It smells like spearmint (Mentha spicata) or coyote mint (Monardella villosa) and the flowers look like those of purple sage (Salvia leucophylla), but smaller.\n\n\n\n\nWE’D LOVE YOUR HELP!\n\nVolunteer or donate to BOSF\nLATEST NEWS\n\nOur Field Guide to 13 delicious edible plants in the Bay Area, many of which are abundant worldwide, might help people improve their food security in the age of COVID-19. 8th Annual Wild/Feral Food Week 20-28 May 2022!

    "text": "We’ve found the following wild and feral edible plants in the East Bay urban ecosystem. “Spp.” after a genus name means we found more than one species. Species in bold font are particularly abundant.\nSpecies with edible parts are highlighted in green.\nNot all parts of nominally “edible” plants are edible: Parts of some edible plants are toxic.\nEdible parts of some nominally “edible” plants require special preparation to be edible. For instance, coast live oak acorns (Quercus agrifolia), California bay laurel nuts (Umbellularia californica), California buckeye nuts (Aesculus californica), bamboo shoots (Bambusa spp., Chimonobambusa spp., Phyllostachys spp.), and pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) range from inedible to toxic unless they are prepared properly. Edible parts of some “edible” plants are edible only at particular stages of their development.\nDo not rely on the “common name” to identify a plant: There are different plants with the same common name, some of which are edible and some of which are toxic. For instance, in some parts of the country, Queen Anne’s Lace refers to an edible wild carrot (Daucus carota), and in others it refers to poison hemlock, (Conium maculatum). Mistakes can be fatal.\nCalflora has a list of toxic plants according to the California Poison Control System.\nDo not consume any part of any plant listed here unless you are quite sure you know what
