#### [Inver Restaurant](https://inverrestaurant.co.uk/) (Argyll, Scotland, UK)

Walking to work in rural Inver Restaurant is like browsing a fresh produce market- except everything is free for the taking! This time of year the menu is full of wild garlic and wild leeks, tender shoreline seaweeds like pepper dulse, and spring’s early edible flowers like ladies’ smock (cuckoo flower). But for WFFW For Wild & Feral Food Week 2021 we’ll be serving the whole garden on our evening tasting menu. Expect snacks to start like “seedlings and seeds”- self-seeded amaranth and brassica seedlings, served with a pumpkin seed miso “bagna cauda” dip (basically we’ve helped gardener Kate make money from weeding!). Spring’s tender, richly mineral nettles feature with the lamb course, and last year’s shooting and flowering kale plants are pruned and served with a buckwheat and broccoli tart and a savoury custard made with local farmhouse cheese. Even the rhubarb meringue is garnished with the primroses that grow in the hedgerows bordering the garden.

#### [Foraging with “Wildman”](http://www.wildmanstevebrill.com/) (New Rochelle, NY, USA)

Naturalist-author “Wildman” Steve Brill is America’s go-to guy for foraging. He’s been leading foraging tours and providing demos for the public, for schools, day camps, birthday parties, museums, nature centers, parks departments, restaurants and chefs, garden clubs, hiking clubs, teaching farms, nurseries, and other organizations, in parks and natural areas throughout the Greater NY area, since 1982. He created his own website, Foraging with the “Wildman.”

His Identifying and Harvesting Edible and Medicinal Plants in Wild (and Not-So-Wild) Places (William Morrow Publishers, 1994) is considered a classic on the subject. His innovative Wild Vegan Cookbook (Harvard Common Press, April, 2002) is changing the way people think of preparing gourmet food. His Shoots and Greens of Early Spring in Northeastern North America (self-published, 1986, revised and expanded 2008) teaches people how the foraging season begins, his Foraging with Kids introduces children to the natural world and his Foraging New York (Globe-Pequot Press, 2017) covers the best local species. His Foraging With the “Wildman” DVD is showing people how it’s all done, and his iOS/Android app, Wild Edibles Forage, is the best foraging app in America.

But the world-famous environmental educator is still best known for having been *handcuffed and arrested by undercover park rangers* who infiltrated a tour, *for eating a dandelion in Central Park*!

**What:** wild food “tours” collecting common, seasonal, renewable edible/medicinal plants and mushrooms  
**Where and When:**
- Belmont Lake State Park, N. Babylon, NY 5/23, 11:30am
- Prospect Park, Brooklyn, NY 5/29 11:45am
**Registration:** Sign up on [Wildman’s website](http://www.wildmanstevebrill.com/) or call him at (914) 835-2153.  
**Cost:** suggested donation $20/adult, $10/child under 12.
