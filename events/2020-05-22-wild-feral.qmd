#### [Shared Cultures](https://www.shared-cultures.com/) (San Francisco, California, USA)

Eleana is a fermentress focused on transforming foods with the magic of microbes and koji. What makes her most excited is creating new food products and flavors using local produce and whole utilization techniques. Eleana has experience teaching koji workshops in the Bay Area and crafting ferments for local popup dinners and events. Currently, she is hunkered down at home working on launching unique great tasting fermented food products in the Bay Area. You can find and follow her on Instagram @SharedCultures.

Learn how to make your own umami sauces that are high in amino acids using foraged mushrooms, food scraps, and koji.

We will specifically be using porcini mushrooms and whatever leftovers in the kitchen to create a highly nutritious and delicious soy sauce alternative.
