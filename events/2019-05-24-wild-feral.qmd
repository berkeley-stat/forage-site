#### [Life by Lisen](mailto:lisen@lifebylisen.com) (Stockholm, Sweden)

Metamorfos. Förvandling. Förändring. Omdaning.

THIS WORKSHOP WILL BE HELD IN SWEDISH Vi är natur. Vi ingår i samma system, lever under samma villkor och följer samma cykler. Den här dagen får du djupdyka i dig själv som natur – existentiellt och konkret och hitta nya vägar att omfamna livets förändring. Under en vårdag kombinerar vi existentiellt utforskande med skogsvandringar och direktkontakt med naturen.

SÅ HÄR GÅR DET TILL Först närmar vi oss det existentiella. Vad är det att vara en del av naturen, att leva i metamorfos, att vara i ständig förändring. Sedan går vi ut i skogen runt knuten. Möter naturens pånyttfödelse. Och där i en glänta får du lära dig mer om vilda växter, och hur de kan bli en del av din matkultur. På vägen hem plockar vi det vi behöver för att laga en vild vegetarisk måltid tillsammans. Efter maten får du en stund för dig själv – vandra, skriv, fundera. Sedan samlas vi, fikar och reflekterar kring hur metamorfos kan vara en del av vår livsförståelse.

KURSLEDARE Ann Lagerström, existentiell samtalsledare och författare bidrar med existentiell filosofi och psykologi. Lisen Sundgren, kostrådgivare och en av våra främsta kännare av örter och vilda växter, introducerar er till naturen som källa till hälsa och njutning. Saturday May 25 Time: 9 am – 5 pm Price: 2000 kr ink. moms, all meals included Contact med for registration: Lisen Sundgren, lisen@lifebylisen.com

WILD WALK AT ROSENDALS GARDEN MAY 28 Välkommen ut i det gröna! Smaka på den frodiga grönskan som bjuder på svinmålla, älggräs, röllika, björklöv och andra delikatesser. Tisdag 28 maj kl. 17.00 – 18.30

Ogräs är framtidens mat! Vilda växter förtjänar en högre status. Låt maskrosor, kirskål och svinmålla frodas istället , och ät upp dem. Vilda ätliga växter är inte bara kokheta inom den moderna gastronomin, men också bland det mest näringsrika och miljövänliga du kan äta. Och ett fantastiskt sätt att knyta an till naturen.

För att plocka och använda vilda växter krävs kunskap om hur och var man får plocka, hur man identifierar vad som är ätligt och hur växterna tillagas. Under vandringen får du tips om hur vanliga vilda växter tillagas till mat, samt hudvårdsprodukter och hur de kan förbättra din hälsa. Lisen Sundgren är herbalist, forager, författare och en ivrig förespråkare för ett liv i samklang med naturen. Hon samarbetar med flera framstående kockar och varit med och utvecklat köket på flera krogar.

Hennes två senaste böcker, Det Vilda Köket och Vildvuxet finns att köpa på plats. Obs! klädsel efter väder då vi är ute Deltagaravgift: 350 kr Register here: https://dinkurs.se/appliance/?event_id=59088

#### [Shiso Studio](http://shiso-studio.com/mrs-phinks-house) (Copenhagen, Denmark)

Shiso Studio is hosting a series of dinners pertaining to only really wild landscape in Denmark – the coast line. The concept of the dinners focuses on saltwater, and they have created a planting palette for the dinners based around coastal plants in Denmark. Why saltwater? – it is working on two levels. The first is a discussion on climate change and how saltwater will become more prevalent in the future, and the second reason is that the Danish coast is special part of Danish landscape and culinary history.

The dinners are held May 23rd – June 8th in Copenhagen in an old military bunker in Copenhagen that has been consumed by plants over time. The price for ticket is 515dkk (approx $85) For tickets and reservations, visit [here](http://shiso-studio.com/mrs-phinks-house)
