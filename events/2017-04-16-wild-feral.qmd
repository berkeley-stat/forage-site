## Restaurants and Events | Farms, Foragers, & Suppliers

Berkeley Open Source Food proudly presents the **Third Annual Wild/Feral Food Week** (16â€“22 April 2017), a landmark culinary experience at some of the world's most innovative restaurants. This event highlights the culinary opportunity of "pandigenous" wild foods, reduces food and water waste, increases revenue to farmers, promotes farm biodiversity, and creates a supply chain and market for wild and feral foods.
